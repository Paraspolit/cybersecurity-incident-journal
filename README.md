## Entry 1  
**Date:** July 1, 2025  

**Description:**  
A ransomware attack targeted a small healthcare clinic in Western Australia, causing a complete shutdown of operations after staff reported they couldnâ€™t access medical records or systems. A ransom note was displayed on employee computers demanding payment to decrypt the files.

**Tool(s) used:**  
None at this stage. Tools to be considered for incident investigation may include antivirus software, email security tools, backup systems, and forensic analysis platforms.

**The 5 W's:**  
- **Who:** An organized group of unethical hackers known for targeting healthcare and transportation sectors.  
- **What:** Attackers sent phishing emails with malicious attachments. Once opened, ransomware encrypted critical files and demanded payment.  
- **When:** Tuesday, July 1, 2025, at approximately 9:00 a.m.  
- **Where:** A small healthcare clinic located in Western Australia.  
- **Why:** The incident happened due to a successful phishing campaign exploiting employee action, allowing ransomware to be deployed and critical systems to be encrypted.

**Additional notes:**  
This incident highlights the critical need for phishing awareness training, email filtering, and reliable data backup systems. A formal incident response plan should be implemented and tested regularly.

## Entry 2  
**Date:** July 21, 2025  

**Description:**  
A data leakage incident occurred at a WA healthcare clinic due to a misconfigured cloud storage bucket. Sensitive patient information was inadvertently made publicly accessible, prompting an urgent response from the IT security team.

**Tool(s) used:**  
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Azure configuration scanner, and data loss prevention (DLP) tool.

**The 5 W's:**  
- **Who:** The internal IT team unintentionally misconfigured a cloud storage setting.  
- **What:** A cloud bucket containing sensitive patient records (including personally identifiable information) was exposed to the public internet without authentication.  
- **When:** During a routine security audit on the morning of July 21, 2025.  
- **Where:** Cloud infrastructure used by a WA-based healthcare provider.  
- **Why:** A lack of automated misconfiguration detection and poor access control policies led to the accidental data exposure.

**Additional notes:**  
This incident emphasizes the importance of cloud security audits, automated configuration monitoring, and regular staff training. Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with security guardrails could prevent similar incidents.
